# Student-Relationships-Based-on-Academic-Performance-using-Social-Network-Analysis
Using SNA methods to understand and analyse the student academic relationships in online education systems.

Abstract: With COVID-19, many academic institutions are rapidly changing the basic way they do their work. The COVID-19
pandemic forced academic institutions worldwide to incorporate the online education paradigm to execute academic activities
without any hindrance. This makes it difficult for students in terms of interaction and thus affects the quality of education.
Because of online mode, students have become more isolated and less socially active which is also affecting their mentality.
And since, there is no traditional classroom setting, teachers are not able to understand the changes in students, their abilities,
their pace, their behavior, and grasp on the courses. From the perspective of the faculty, the student community is like a
black box and creates a problem for the proper evaluation of students. And this is the reason that we need some better
understanding about the students. For example, observing the behavior of a particular student or a group of students, finding
similar-minded students or groups of students, etc. In this work, we try to analyze this situation using the tools and methods
of SNA. The SNA studies the interactions and connections among entities in a network based on some relationship. We
employ correlation-based similarity measures using the academic performance of students to generate a network of students.
